# Blockhead
### There and back again, a 3D pixel's story...

One of the fascinating things to me is how ARKit enables a blending of visual realities (what you see and what the device shows you). I wanted to explore this in detail, plus learn more about how a 3D point/pixel can be projected from 3D space into 2D coordinates, then re-applied back in 3D space. So, Blockhead is an attempt to do something visually interesting with ARKit, the True-Depth camera, and develop some transform utilities to make all the coordinate space conversions easier to grasp.
